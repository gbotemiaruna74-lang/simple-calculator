# 🧮 Simple Calculator in Python

## 📘 Project Description
This is a beginner‑friendly calculator built with Python.  
It can perform the following operations:
- Addition ➕
- Subtraction ➖
- Multiplication ✖
- Division ➗

## 🌀 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
1. *Requirement Gathering* – Decide calculator functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
2. *Design* – Plan inputs (two numbers, operator) and outputs (result).
3. *Implementation* – Write Python code with functions for each operation.
4. *Testing* – Try different numbers and check results.
5. *Deployment* – Upload the project to GitHub.
6. *Maintenance* – Add new features later (e.g., square root, power, history).

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
